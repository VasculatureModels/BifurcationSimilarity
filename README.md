# BifurcationSimilarity


## The aim of this subjective test is to assess the similarities between cerebral vascular tree bifurcations

Two distinct bifurcations are shown side by side onto a 3D display,
one is an original bifurcation (as acquired from a TOF-MRA), 
whereas the other has been generated from a synthetic vasculature model.

The observers needs to evaluate the similarities using the 10 buttons positioned at the top of the browser window.
